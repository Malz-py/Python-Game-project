# Number Guessing Game – Instructions

## 🎯 Objective

Try to guess the randomly selected number chosen by the computer within the fewest attempts possible!

---

## 🕹 How to Play

1. The computer selects a random number between **1 and 100**.
2. You will be prompted to guess the number.
3. After each guess, the game will give you feedback:
   - **"Too high!"** if your guess is above the number.
   - **"Too low!"** if your guess is below the number.
   - **"Correct!"** if you guess the right number.

## 🧠 Tips

- Use the feedback after each guess to narrow down your next guess.
- Try using a binary search approach: guess in the middle of the range to cut possibilities in half each time.

## 🏁 Game End

- The game ends when you guess the correct number.
- Your total number of attempts will be displayed.
- You can then close the game or restart to try again.
